    "### 1.1 Business Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel is a communications company that offers mobile and communications services to it's customers. Customer churn refers to a situation where customers stop using company's products or services over a given period. In the telecommunications industry, this often means customers cancel their mobile, internet, or bundled service subscriptions and switch to a competitor.\n",
    "The business goal is to reduce customer churn, which directly impacts revenue and long-term profitability. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage data, SyriaTel aims to identify customers who are likely to leave and implement proactive strategies to retain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel is experiencing a significant number of customers discontinuing their services. Losing customers not only affects immediate revenue but also increases customer acquisition costs. The problem is to identify patterns in customer data that signal a high risk of churn and develop a predictive model to flag such customers before they leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Objective:\n",
    "To build a predictive model that accurately identifies customers at risk of churning, allowing the business to take timely retention actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To Identify and prioritize the top churn drivers.\n",
    "* To determine how much revenue is lost due to customer churn.\n",
    "* To build a baseline model to predict churn with interpretable results.\n",
    "* To compare and evaluate the performance of different models to determine the most effective.\n",
    "* To optimize pricing for retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the top churn factors driving customer churn?\n",
    "* How much revenue is lost due to customer churn over a given period?\n",
    "* Can a baseline machine learning model accurately predict whether a customer will churn?\n",
    "* Which machine learning model performs best in predicting churn based on classification metrics?\n",
    "* How does pricing impact customer retention, and what pricing strategies can be implemented to reduce churn without significantly impacting revenue?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
<<<<<<< HEAD
    "This project will be considered successful if we prepare a clean dataset that highlights churn patterns, build a predictive model with strong performance on metrics like recall, precision and ROC-AUC and generate insights that SyriaTel can use to reduce churn and strengthen customer loyalty."

    "## Data Source¶\n",
    "The project uses the SyriaTel Customer Churn dataset which is provided in a CSV format. The data is publicly available on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a tabular dataset where each row represents a customer and each column provides information about customer behavior, service usage and phone numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main column of interest is the target variable, Churn, which shows whether a customer has left the company (True) or remained with the company (False)"
=======
    "### 2.1 Dataset Overview\n",
    "The dataset contains historical information about customers which includes their usage patterns and trends and interactions with customer service. The target variable is churn, which indicates whether a customer has left the service (1 = Left or 0 = Stayed). \n",
    "#### 2.2 Data Quality Checks\n",
    " - *Missing Values:* Check for null or missing entries in any column. In SyriaTel there are no missing values.\n",
    " - *Data Types:* Ensure numeric columns (e.g., minutes, charges, calls) are of numeric types for correlation and modelling. Convert the churn column to numeric instead of it being float. \n",
    " - *Outliers:* Identify unusually high or low values (e.g, extremely high day minutes) that may affect the model and churn is the Target variable.\n",
    "#### 2.3 Exploration Insights\n",
    "* Features like customer service calls, total day charge and total day minutes show a higher correlation with churn, these shows that they are key indicators of potential churn.\n",
    "* Other usage and billing features have weak correlation but may still contribute when combined in a predictive model.\n",
    "* Categorical features such as area code are less likely to impact churn individually but may have subtle effects in combination with other variables.\n"
